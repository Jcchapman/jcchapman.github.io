<p>of 15 May 2014

<p>(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,</p>

<p>Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,</p>

<p>Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,</p>

<p>After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,</p>

<p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank ( 1 ),</p>

<p>Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ),</p>

<p>Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure ( 3 ),</p>

<p>Whereas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The financial crisis has exposed weaknesses in the transparency of financial markets which can contribute to
harmful socioeconomic effects. Strengthening transparency is one of the shared principles to strengthen the
financial system as confirmed by the G20 Leadersâ statement in London on 2 April 2009. In order to strengthen
the transparency and improve the functioning of the internal market for financial instruments, a new framework
establishing uniform requirements for the transparency of transactions in markets for financial instruments should
be put in place. The framework should establish comprehensive rules for a broad range of financial instruments. It
should complement requirements for the transparency of orders and transactions in respect of shares established in
Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 4 ).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The High-Level Group on Financial Supervision in the EU chaired by Jacques de LarosiÃ¨re invited the Union to
develop a more harmonised set of financial regulations. In the context of the future European supervision
architecture, the European Council of 18 and 19 June 2009 stressed the need to establish a European single
rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the internal market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The new legislation should as a consequence consist of two different legal instruments, a Directive and this
Regulation. Together, both legal instruments should form the legal framework governing the requirements
applicable to investment firms, regulated markets and data reporting services providers. This Regulation should
therefore be read together with the Directive. The need to establish a single set of rules for all institutions in
respect of certain requirements and to avoid potential regulatory arbitrage as well as to provide more legal
certainty and less regulatory complexity for market participants warrants the use of a legal basis allowing for
the creation of a Regulation. In order to remove the remaining obstacles to trade and significant distortions of
competition resulting from divergences between national laws and to prevent any further likely obstacles to trade
and significant distortions of competition from arising, it is therefore necessary to adopt a Regulation establishing

( 3 ) Position of the European Parliament of 15 April 2014 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of
13 May 2014.
( 4 ) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments
amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC (OJ L 145, 30.4.2004, p. 1).</p>

<p>uniform rules applicable in all Member States. This directly applicable legal act aims at contributing in a deterÂ­
mining manner to the smooth functioning of the internal market and should, consequently, be based on
Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as interpreted in accordance with
the consistent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Directive 2004/39/EC established rules for making the trading in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market
pre-trade and post-trade transparent and for reporting transactions in financial instruments admitted to trading on
a regulated market to competent authorities. The directive needs to be recast in order to appropriately reflect
developments in financial markets and to address weaknesses and close loopholes that were, inter alia, exposed in
the financial market crisis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provisions in respect of trade and regulatory transparency requirements need to take the form of directly applicable
law applied to all investment firms that should follow uniform rules in all Union markets, in order to provide for a
uniform application of a single regulatory framework, to strengthen confidence in the transparency of markets
across the Union, to reduce regulatory complexity and investment firmsâ compliance costs, especially for financial
institutions operating on a cross-border basis, and to contribute to the elimination of distortions of competition.
The adoption of a regulation ensuring direct applicability is best suited to accomplish those regulatory goals and
ensure uniform conditions by preventing diverging national requirements as a result of the transposition of a
directive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is important to ensure that trading in financial instruments is carried out as far as possible on organised venues
and that all such venues are appropriately regulated. Under Directive 2004/39/EC, some trading systems developed
which were not adequately captured by the regulatory regime. Any trading system in financial instruments, such as
entities currently known as broker crossing networks, should in the future be properly regulated and be authorised
under one of the types of multilateral trading venues or as a systematic internaliser under the conditions set out in
this Regulation and in Directive 2014/65/EU ( 1 ).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The definitions of regulated market and multilateral trading facility (MTF) should be clarified and remain closely
aligned with each other to reflect the fact that they represent effectively the same organised trading functionality.
The definitions should exclude bilateral systems where an investment firm enters into every trade on own account,
even as a riskless counterparty interposed between the buyer and seller. Regulated markets and MTFs should not be
allowed to execute client orders against proprietary capital. The term âsystemâ encompasses all those markets that
are composed of a set of rules and a trading platform as well as those that only function on the basis of a set of
rules. Regulated markets and MTFs are not obliged to operate a âtechnicalâ system for matching orders and should
be able to operate other trading protocols including systems whereby users are able to trade against quotes they
request from multiple providers. A market which is only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related to
membership, admission of instruments to trading, trading between members, reporting and, where applicable,
transparency obligations is a regulated market or an MTF within the meaning of this Regulation and the transÂ­
actions concluded under those rules are considered to be concluded under the systems of a regulated market or an
MTF. The term âbuying and selling interestsâ is to be understood in a broad sense and includes orders, quotes and
indications of interest.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One of the important requirements concerns the obligation that the interests be brought together in the system by
means of non-discretionary rules set by the system operator. That requirement means that they are brought
together under the systemâs rules or by means of the systemâs protocols or internal operating procedures,
including procedures embodied in computer software. The term ânon-discretionary rulesâ means rules that leave
the regulated market or the market operator or investment firm operating an MTF with no discretion as to how
interests may interact. The definitions require that interests be brought together in such a way as to result in a
contract which occurs where execution takes place under the systemâs rules or by means of the systemâs protocols
or internal operating procedures.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In order to make Union financial markets more transparent and efficient and to level the playing field between
various venues offering multilateral trading services it is necessary to introduce a new trading venue category of
organised trading facility (OTF) for bonds, structured finance products, emissions allowances and derivatives and to
ensure that it is appropriately regulated and applies non-discriminatory rules regarding access to the facility. That

</ol>

<p>( 1 ) Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and
amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (See page 349 of this Official Journal).</p>

<p>new category is broadly defined so that now and in the future it should be able to capture all types of organised
execution and arranging of trading which do not correspond to the functionalities or regulatory specifications of
existing venues. Consequently, appropriate organisational requirements and transparency rules which support
efficient price discovery need to be applied. The new category encompasses systems eligible for trading
clearing-eligible and sufficiently liquid derivatives.</p>

<p>It should not include facilities where there is no genuine trade execution or arranging taking place in the system,
such as bulletin boards used for advertising buying and selling interests, other entities aggregating or pooling
potential buying or selling interests, electronic post-trade confirmation services, or portfolio compression, which
reduces non-market risks in existing derivatives portfolios without changing the market risk of the portfolios.
Portfolio compression may be provided by a range of firms which are not regulated as such by this Regulation or
by Directive 2014/65/EU, such as central counterparties (CCPs), trade repositories as well as by investment firms or
market operators. It is appropriate to clarify that where investment firms and market operators carry out portfolio
compression certain provisions of this Regulation and of Directive 2014/65/EU are not applicable in relation to
portfolio compression. Since central securities depositories (CSDs) will be subject to the same requirements as
investment firms when providing certain investment services or performing certain investment activities, the
provisions of this Regulation and of Directive 2014/65/EU should not be applicable to firms that are not
regulated thereby when carrying out portfolio compression.</p>

<ol>
  <li>That new category OTF will complement the existing types of trading venues. While regulated markets and MTFs
have non-discretionary rules for the execution of transactions, the operator of an OTF should carry out order
execution on a discretionary basis subject, where applicable, to the pre-transparency requirements and best
execution obligations. Consequently, conduct of business rules, best execution and client order handling
obligations should apply to the transactions concluded on an OTF operated by an investment firm or a market
operator. In addition, any market operator authorised to operate an OTF should comply with Chapter 1 of
Directive 2014/65/EU regarding conditions and procedures for authorisation of investment firms. The investment
firm or the market operator operating an OTF should be able to exercise discretion at two different levels: first
when deciding to place an order on the OTF or to retract it again and second when deciding not to match a
specific order with the orders available in the system at a given point in time, provided that that complies with
specific instructions received from clients and with best execution obligations.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the system that crosses client orders the operator should be able to decide if, when and how much of two or
more orders it wants to match within the system. In accordance with Article 20(1), (2), (4) and (5) of Directive
2014/65/EU and without prejudice to Article 20(3) of Directive 2014/65/EU, the firm should be able to facilitate
negotiation between clients as to bring together two or more potentially compatible trading interests in a transÂ­
action. At both discretionary levels the OTF operator must have regard to its obligations under Articles 18 and 27
of Directive 2014/65/EU. The market operator or investment firm operating an OTF should make clear to users of
the venue how they will exercise discretion. Because an OTF constitutes a genuine trading platform, the platform
operator should be neutral. Therefore, the investment firm or market operator operating the OTF should be subject
to requirements in relation to non-discriminatory execution and neither the investment firm or market operator
operating the OTF nor any entity that is part of the same group or legal person as the investment firm or market
operator should be allowed to execute client orders in an OTF against its proprietary capital.</p>

<p>For the purpose of facilitating the execution of one or more client orders in bonds, structured finance products,
emission allowances and derivatives that have not been declared subject to the clearing obligation in accordance
with Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), an OTF
operator is permitted to use matched principal trading within the meaning of Directive 2014/65/EU provided
the client has consented to that process. In relation to sovereign debt instruments for which there is not a liquid
market, an investment firm or market operator operating an OTF should be able to engage in dealing on own
account other than matched principal trading. When matched principal trading is used all pre-trade and post-trade
transparency requirements as well as best execution obligations must be complied with. The OTF operator or any
entity that is part of the same group or legal person as the investment firm or market operator should not act as
systematic internaliser in the OTF operated by it. Furthermore, the operator of an OTF should be subject to the
same obligations as an MTF in relation to the sound management of potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<ol>
  <li>All organised trading should be conducted on regulated venues and be fully transparent, both pre and post trade.
Appropriately calibrated transparency requirements therefore need to apply to all types of trading venues, and to
all financial instruments traded thereon.

<p>( 1 ) Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterÂ­
parties and trade repositories (OJ L 201, 27.7.2012, p. 1).</p>

<ol>
  <li>In order to ensure more trading takes place on regulated trading venues and systematic internalisers, a trading
obligation for shares admitted to trading on a regulated market or traded on a trading venue should be introduced
for investment firms in this Regulation. That trading obligation requires investment firms to undertake all trades
including trades dealt on own account and trades dealt when executing client orders on a regulated market, an
MTF, a systematic internaliser or an equivalent third-country trading venue. However an exclusion from that
trading obligation should be provided if there is a legitimate reason. Those legitimate reasons are where trades
are non-systematic, ad-hoc, irregular and infrequent, or are technical trades such as give-up trades which do not
contribute to the price discovery process. Such an exclusion from that trading obligation should not be used to
circumvent the restrictions introduced on the use of the reference price waiver and the negotiated price waiver or
to operate a broker crossing network or other crossing system.</li>
</ol>

<p>The option for trades to be done on a systematic internaliser is without prejudice to the systematic internaliser
regime laid down in this Regulation. The intention is that if the investment firm itself meets the relevant criteria
laid down in this Regulation to be deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the trade may be dealt
in that way; however, if it is not deemed a systematic internaliser in that particular share, the investment firm
should still be able to undertake the trade on another systematic internaliser where that complies with its best
execution obligations and the option is available to it. In addition, in order to ensure that multilateral trading with
respect to shares, depositary receipts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates and other similar financial
instruments is properly regulated, an investment firm that operates an internal matching system on a multilateral
basis should be authorised as an MTF. It should be clarified that the best execution provisions set out in Directive
2014/65/EU should be applied in such a manner as not to impede the trading obligations under this Regulation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Trading in depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates, similar financial instruments and shares other than those admitted
to trading on a regulated market takes place in largely the same fashion, and fulfils a nearly identical economic
purpose, as trading in shares admitted to trading on a regulated market. Transparency provisions applicable to
shares admitted to trading on regulated markets should thus be extended to those financial instruments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While, in principle, acknowledging the need for a regime of waivers from pre-trade transparency to support the
efficient functioning of markets, the actual waiver provisions for shares applicable on the basis of Directive
2004/39/EC and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 ( 1 ), need to be scrutinised as to their
continued appropriateness in terms of scope and conditions applicable. In order to ensure a uniform application
of the waivers from pre-trade transparency in shares and eventually other similar financial instruments and non-
equity products for specific market models and types and sizes of orders, the European Supervisory Authority
(European Securities and Markets Authority), established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European
Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ) (âESMAâ), should assess the compatibility of individual requests for applying a
waiver with rules laid down in this Regulation and in delegated acts provided for in this Regulation. ESMAâs
assessment should take the form of an opinion in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010.
In addition, the already existing waivers for shares should be reviewed by ESMA within an appropriate timeframe
and an assessment should be made, following the same procedure, as to whether they are still in compliance with
the rules set out in this Regulation and in delegated acts provided for in this Regulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The financial crisis exposed specific weaknesses in the way information on trading opportunities and prices in
financial instruments other than shares is available to market participants, namely in terms of timing, granularity,
equal access, and reliability. Timely pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements taking account of the
different characteristics and market structures of specific types of financial instruments other than shares should
thus be introduced and calibrated for different types of trading systems, including order-book, quote-driven, hybrid,
periodic auction trading and voice trading systems. In order to provide a sound transparency framework for all
relevant financial instruments, these should apply to bonds, structured finance products, emission allowances and
derivatives which are traded on a trading venue. Therefore, exemptions from pre-trade transparency and adapÂ­
tations of the requirements in relation to deferred publication should be available only in certain defined cases.

Decision 2009/77/EC (OJ L 331, 15.12.2010, p. 84).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is necessary to introduce an appropriate level of trade transparency in markets for bonds, structured finance
products and derivatives in order to help the valuation of products as well as the efficiency of price formation.
Structured finance products should, in particular, include asset backed securities as defined in Article 2(5) of
Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 ( 1 ), comprising among others collateralised debt obligations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to ensure uniform applicable conditions between trading venues, the same pre-trade and post-trade
transparency requirements should apply to the different types of venues. The transparency requirements should
be calibrated for different types of financial instruments, including equities, bonds, and derivatives, taking into
account the interests of investors and issuers, including government bond issuers, and market liquidity. The
requirements should be calibrated for different types of trading, including order-book and quote-driven systems
such as request for quote as well as hybrid and voice broking systems, and take account of transaction size,
including turnover, and other relevant criteria.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to avoid any negative impact on the price formation process, it is necessary to introduce an appropriate
volume cap mechanism for orders placed in systems which are based on a trading methodology by which the price
is determined in accordance with a reference price and for certain negotiated transactions. That mechanism should
have a double cap, whereby a volume cap is applied to each trading venue that uses those waivers so that only a
certain percentage of trading can be done on each trading venue, and in addition an overall volume cap is applied
which if exceeded would result in the suspension of use of those waivers across the Union. In relation to the
negotiated transactions, it should only apply to those transactions that are made within the current volume
weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers of the trading venue
operating that system. It should exclude negotiated transactions in illiquid shares, depositary receipts, ETFs,
certificates or other similar financial instruments, and those transactions that are subject to conditions other
than the current market price as they do not contribute to the price formation process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to ensure that trading carried out OTC does not jeopardise efficient price discovery or a transparent level
playing field between means of trading, appropriate pre-trade transparency requirements should apply to
investment firms dealing on own account in financial instruments OTC insofar as it is carried out in their
capacity as systematic internalisers in relation to shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates or other similar
financial instruments for which there is a liquid market and bonds, structured finance products, emission
allowances and derivatives which are traded on a trading venue and for which there is a liquid market.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An investment firm executing client orders against own proprietary capital should be deemed a systematic interÂ­
naliser, unless the transactions are carried out outside a trading venue on an occasional, ad hoc and irregular basis.
Thus, systematic internalisers should be defined as investment firms which, on an organised, frequent systematic
and substantial basis, deal on own account by executing client orders outside a trading venue. The requirements for
systematic internalisers in this Regulation should apply to an investment firm only in relation to each single
financial instrument, for example on ISIN-code level, in which it is a systematic internaliser. In order to ensure an
objective and effective application of the definition of systematic internaliser to investment firms, there should be a
pre-determined threshold for systematic internalisation containing an exact specification of what is meant by
frequent, systematic and substantial basis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While an OTF is any system or facility in which multiple third-party buying and selling interests interact in the
system, a systematic internaliser should not be allowed to bring together third-party buying and selling interests.
For instance, a so-called single-dealer platform, where trading always takes place against a single investment firm,
should be considered a systematic internaliser, were it to comply with the requirements included in this Regulation.
However, a so-called multi-dealer platform, with multiple dealers interacting for the same financial instrument,
should not be considered a systematic internaliser.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Systematic internalisers should be able to decide on the basis of their commercial policy and in an objective non-
discriminatory way the clients to whom they give access to their quotes, distinguishing between categories of
clients, and should also be entitled to take account of distinctions between clients, for example in relation to credit
risk. Systematic internalisers should not be obliged to publish firm quotes, execute client orders and give access to

carried out on an OTC basis, other than within a systematic internaliser.</p>

    <p>Market data should be easily and readily available to users in a format as disaggregated as possible to allow
investors, and data service providers serving their needs, to customise data solutions to the furthest possible degree.
Therefore, pre-trade and post-trade transparency data should be made available to the public in an âunbundledâ

  <li>
    <p>Considering the agreement reached by the parties to the G20 Pittsburgh summit on 25 September 2009 to move
trading in standardised OTC derivative contracts to exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate, a
formal regulatory procedure should be defined for mandating trading between financial counterparties and large
non-financial counterparties in all derivatives which have been considered to be clearing-eligible and which are
sufficiently liquid to take place on a range of trading venues subject to comparable regulation and enabling
participants to trade with multiple counterparties. The assessment of sufficient liquidity should take account of
market characteristics at national level including elements such as the number and type of market participants in a
given market, and of transaction characteristics, such as the size and frequency of transactions in that market.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A liquid market in a product class of derivatives will be characterised by a high number of active market
participants, including a suitable mix of liquidity providers and liquidity takers, relative to the number of traded
products, which execute trades frequently in those products in sizes below a size that is large in scale. Such market
activity should be indicated by a high number of resting bids and offers in the relevant derivative leading to a
narrow spread for a transaction of normal market size. The assessment of sufficient liquidity should recognize that
the liquidity of a derivative can vary significantly according to market conditions and its life cycle.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Considering the agreement reached by the parties to the G20 in Pittsburgh on 25 September 2009 to move
trading in standardised OTC derivative contracts to exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate on
the one hand, and the relatively lower liquidity of various OTC derivatives on the other, it is appropriate to provide
for a suitable range of eligible venues on which trading pursuant to that commitment can take place. All eligible
venues should be subject to closely aligned regulatory requirements in terms of organisational and operational
aspects, arrangements to mitigate conflicts of interest, surveillance of all trading activity, pre-trade and post-trade
transparency calibrated by financial instrument and types of trading system, and for multiple third-party trading
interests to be able to interact with one another. The possibility for operators of venues to arrange transactions
pursuant to that commitment between multiple third parties in a discretionary fashion should however be
provided for in order to improve the conditions for execution and liquidity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The obligation to conclude transactions in derivatives pertaining to a class of derivatives that has been declared
subject to the trading obligation on a regulated market, MTF, OTF or third country trading venue should not apply
to the components of non-price forming post-trade risk reduction services which reduce non-market risks in
derivatives portfolios including existing OTC derivatives portfolios in accordance with Regulation (EU)
No 648/2012 without changing the market risk of the portfolios. In addition, while it is appropriate to make
specific provision for portfolio compression, this Regulation is not intended to prevent the use of other post-trade
risk reduction services.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The trading obligation established for those derivatives should allow for efficient competition between eligible
trading venues. Therefore those trading venues should not be able to claim exclusive rights in relation to any
derivatives subject to that trading obligation preventing other trading venues from offering trading in those
financial instruments. For effective competition between trading venues for derivatives, it is essential that
trading venues have non-discriminatory and transparent access to CCPs. Non-discriminatory access to a CCP
should mean that a trading venue has the right to non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts
traded on its platform are treated in terms of collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent
contracts and cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP, and non-discriminatory
clearing fees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Competent authoritiesâ powers should be complemented with an explicit mechanism for prohibiting or restricting
the marketing, distribution and sale of any financial instrument or structured deposit giving rise to serious
concerns regarding investor protection, orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets, or commodities
markets, or the stability of the whole or part of the financial system, together with appropriate coordination and
contingency powers for ESMA or, for structured deposits, the European Supervisory Authority (European Banking
Authority) (EBA), established by Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ).
The exercise of such powers by competent authorities and, in exceptional cases, by ESMA or EBA should be
subject to the need to fulfil a number of specific conditions. Where those conditions are met, the competent
authority or, in exceptional cases, ESMA or EBA should be able to impose a prohibition or restriction on a
precautionary basis before a financial instrument or structured deposit has been marketed, distributed or sold to
clients.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Those powers do not imply any requirement to introduce or apply a product approval or licensing by the
competent authority, ESMA or EBA, and do not relieve investment firms of their responsibility to comply with
the all relevant requirements laid down in this Regulation and in Directive 2014/65/EU. The orderly functioning
and integrity of commodity markets should be included as a criterion for intervention by competent authorities in
order to enable action to be taken to counteract possible negative externalities on commodities markets from
activities on financial markets. This is true, in particular, for agricultural commodity markets the purpose of which
is to ensure a secure supply of food for the population. In those cases, the measures should be coordinated with
the authorities competent for the commodity markets concerned.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Competent authorities should notify ESMA of the details of any of their requests to reduce a position in relation to
a derivative contract, of any one-off limits, as well as of any ex-ante position limits in order to improve coorÂ­
dination and convergence in how those powers are applied. The essential details of any ex-ante position limits
applied by a competent authority should be published on ESMAâs website.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ESMA should be able to request information from any person regarding their position in relation to a derivative
contract, to request that position to be reduced, as well as to limit the ability of persons to undertake individual
transactions in relation to commodity derivatives. ESMA should then notify relevant competent authorities of
measures it proposes to undertake and should publish those measures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The details of transactions in financial instruments should be reported to competent authorities to enable them to
detect and investigate potential cases of market abuse, to monitor the fair and orderly functioning of markets, as
well as the activities of investment firms. The scope of that oversight includes all financial instruments which are
traded on a trading venue and financial instruments where the underlying is a financial instrument traded on a
trading venue or where the underlying is an index or basket composed of financial instruments traded on a trading
venue. The obligation should apply whether or not such transactions in any of those financial instruments were
carried out on a trading venue. In order to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden on investment firms,
financial instruments that are not susceptible to market abuse should be excluded from the reporting obligation.
The reports should use a legal entity identifier in line with the G-20 commitments. ESMA should report to the
Commission on the functioning of such reporting to the competent authorities and the Commission should take
steps to propose any changes where appropriate.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The operator of a trading venue should provide its competent authority with relevant financial instrument
reference data. Those notifications are to be transmitted by the competent authorities without delay to ESMA,
which should publish them immediately on its website to enable ESMA and competent authorities to use, analyse
and exchange transaction reports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to serve their purpose as a tool for market monitoring, transaction reports should identify the person who
has made the investment decision, as well as those responsible for its execution. In addition to the transparency
regime provided for in Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), the
marking of short sales provides useful supplementary information to enable competent authorities to monitor
levels of short selling. Competent authorities need to have full access to records at all stages in the order execution
process, from the initial decision to trade, through to its execution. Therefore, investment firms should keep
records of all their orders and all their transactions in financial instruments, and operators of platforms are
required to keep records of all orders submitted to their systems. ESMA should coordinate the exchange of
information among competent authorities to ensure that they have access to all records of transactions and
orders, including those entered on platforms that operate outside their territory, in financial instruments under
their supervision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double reporting of the same information should be avoided. Reports submitted to trade repositories registered or
recognised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 for the relevant financial instruments which contain
all the required information for transaction reporting purposes should not need to be reported to competent
authorities, but should be transmitted to them by the trade repositories. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should be
amended to that effect.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any exchange or transmission of information by competent authorities should be in accordance with the rules on
the transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC. Any exchange or transmission of information by
ESMA should be in accordance with the rules on the transfer of personal data as laid down in Regulation (EC)
No 45/2001, which should be fully applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this
Regulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 lays down the criteria according to which classes of OTC derivatives should be
subject to the clearing obligation. It prevents competitive distortions by requiring non-discriminatory access to
CCPs offering clearing of OTC derivatives to trading venues and non-discriminatory access to the trade feeds of
trading venues to CCPs offering clearing of OTC derivatives. As OTC derivatives are defined as derivative contracts
whose execution does not take place on a regulated market, there is a need to introduce similar requirements for
regulated markets under this Regulation. Derivatives traded on regulated markets should also be centrally cleared.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In addition to requirements in Directive 2004/39/EC and in Directive 2014/65/EU that prevent Member States
from unduly restricting access to post-trade infrastructure such as CCP and settlement arrangements, it is necessary
that this Regulation removes various other commercial barriers that can be used to prevent competition in the
clearing of financial instruments. To avoid any discriminatory practices, CCPs should accept to clear transactions
executed in different trading venues, to the extent that those venues comply with the operational and technical
requirements established by the CCP, including the risk management requirements. Access should be granted by a
CCP if certain access criteria specified in regulatory technical standards are met. With regard to newly established
CCPs that have been authorised or recognised for a period of less than three years at the point of entry into force
of this Regulation, with respect to transferable securities and money market instruments, there should be the
possibility for competent authorities to approve a transitional period of up to two-and-a-half years before they are
exposed to full non-discriminatory access in relation to transferable securities and money market instruments.
However, if a CCP chooses to avail of the transitional arrangement it should not be able to benefit from the access
rights to a trading venue under this Regulation for the duration of the transitional arrangement. Furthermore, no
trading venue with a close link to that CCP should be able to benefit from the access rights to a CCP under this
Regulation for the duration of the transitional arrangement.

<p>( 1 ) Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 on short selling and certain aspects
of credit default swaps (OJ L 86, 24.3.2012, p. 1).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 lays down the conditions under which non-discriminatory access between CCPs and
trading venues should be granted for OTC derivatives. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 defines OTC derivatives as
derivatives whose execution does not take place on a regulated market or on a third-country market considered as
equivalent to a regulated market in accordance with Article 19(6) of Directive 2004/39/EC. In order to avoid any
gaps or overlaps and to ensure consistency between Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 and this Regulation, the
requirements set out in this Regulation on non-discriminatory access between CCPs and trading venues apply
to derivatives traded on regulated markets or on a third-country market considered as equivalent to a regulated
market in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU and all non-derivative financial instruments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Trading venues should be required to provide access including data feeds on a transparent and non-discriminatory
basis to CCPs that wish to clear transactions executed on a trading venue. However, this should not necessitate the
use of interoperability arrangements for clearing transactions in derivatives or create liquidity fragmentation in a
way that would threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of markets. Access should only be denied by a
trading venue if certain access criteria specified in regulatory technical standards are not met. With regard to
exchange-traded derivatives, it would be disproportionate to require smaller trading venues, particularly those
closely linked to CCPs, to comply with non-discriminatory access requirements immediately if they have not
yet acquired the technological capability to engage on a level playing field with the majority of the post-trade
infrastructure market. Therefore trading venues below the relevant threshold should have the option of exempting
themselves, and therefore their associated CCPs, from non-discriminatory access requirements in respect of
exchange-traded derivatives for a period of 30 months with the possibility of subsequent renewals. However, if
a trading venue chooses to exempt itself, it should not be able to benefit from the access rights to a CCP under this
Regulation for the duration of the exemption.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Furthermore, no CCP with a close link to that trading venue should be able to benefit from the access rights to a
trading venue under this Regulation for the duration of the exemption. Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 identifies
that where commercial and intellectual property rights relate to financial services related to derivative contracts,
licenses should be available on proportionate, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Therefore, access to
licences of, and information relating to, benchmarks that are used to determine the value of financial instruments
should be provided to CCPs and other trading venues on a proportionate, fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
basis and any license should be on reasonable commercial terms. Without prejudice to the application of
competition rules, where any new benchmark is developed following the entry into force of this Regulation an
obligation to licence should start 30 months after a financial instrument referencing that benchmark commenced
trading or was admitted to trading. Access to licenses is critical to facilitate access between trading venues and
CCPs under Article 35 and 36 as otherwise licensing arrangements could still prevent access between trading
venues and CCPs that they have requested access to.</p>

<p>The removal of barriers and discriminatory practices is intended to increase competition for clearing and trading of
financial instruments in order to lower investment and borrowing costs, eliminate inefficiencies and foster innoÂ­
vation in Union markets. The Commission should continue to closely monitor the evolution of post-trade infraÂ­
structure and should, where necessary, intervene in order to prevent competitive distortions from occurring in the
internal market, in particular where the refusal of access to infrastructure or to benchmarks contravenes Articles
101 or 102 TFEU. The licencing duties under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the general obligation
of proprietary owners of benchmarks under Union competition law, and under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU in
particular, concerning access to benchmarks that are indispensable to enter a new market. Approvals of competent
authorities to not apply access rights for transitional periods are not authorisations or amendments of authÂ­

  <li>The provision of services by third-country firms in the Union is subject to national regimes and requirements.
Those regimes are highly differentiated and the firms authorised in accordance with them do not enjoy the
freedom to provide services and the right of establishment in Member States other than the one where they
are established. It is appropriate to introduce a common regulatory framework at Union level. The regime should
harmonise the existing fragmented framework, ensure certainty and uniform treatment of third-country firms
accessing the Union, ensure that an assessment of effective equivalence has been carried out by the Commission
in relation to the prudential and business conduct framework of third countries, and should provide for a
comparable level of protection to clients in the Union receiving services by third-country firms.
L 173/92 EN^ Official Journal of the European Union 12.6.</li>
</ol>

<p>In applying the regime the Commission and Member States should prioritise the areas covered by the G-
commitments and agreements with the Unionâs largest trading partners and should have regard to the central
role that the Union plays in worldwide financial markets and ensure that the application of third-country
requirements does not prevent Union investors and issuers from investing in or obtaining funding from third
countries or third-country investors and issuers from investing, raising capital or obtaining other financial services
in Union markets unless that is necessary for objective and evidence-based prudential reasons. In carrying out the
assessments, the Commission should have regard to the International Organisation of Securities Commissionâs
(IOSCO) Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation and its recommendations as amended and interpreted
by IOSCO.</p>

<p>Where a decision cannot be made determining effective equivalence, the provision of services by third-country
firms in the Union remains subject to national regimes. The Commission should initiate the equivalence assessment
on its own initiative. Member States should be able to indicate their interest that a certain third-country or certain
third countries are subject to the equivalence assessment carried out by the Commission, without such indications
being binding on the Commission to initiate the equivalence process. The equivalence assessment should be
outcome-based; it should assess to what extent the respective third-country regulatory and supervisory
framework achieves similar and adequate regulatory effects and to what extent it meets the same objectives as
Union law. When initiating those equivalence assessments, the Commission should be able to prioritise among
third-country jurisdictions taking into account the materiality of the equivalence finding to Union firms and clients,
the existence of supervisory and cooperation agreements between the third country and the Member States, the
existence of an effective equivalent system for the recognition of investment firms authorised under foreign
regimes as well as the interest and willingness of the third country to engage in the equivalence assessment
process. The Commission should monitor any significant changes to the regulatory and supervisory framework of
the third country and review the equivalence decisions where appropriate.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Under this Regulation, the provision of services without branches should be limited to eligible counterparties and
professional clients per se. It should be subject to registration by ESMA and to supervision in the third country.
Proper cooperation arrangements should be in place between ESMA and the competent authorities in the third
country.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provisions of this Regulation regulating the provision of services or undertaking of activities by third-country
firms should not affect the possibility for persons established in the Union to receive investment services by a
third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative or for Union investment firms or credit institutions to receive
investment services or activities from a third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative or for a client to receive
investment services from a third-country firm at their own exclusive initiative through the mediation of such a
credit institution or investment firm. Where a third-country firm provides services at the own exclusive initiative of
a person established in the Union, the services should not be deemed as provided in the territory of the Union.
Where a third-country firm solicits clients or potential clients in the Union or promotes or advertises investment
services or activities together with ancillary services in the Union, it should not be deemed as a service provided at
the own exclusive initiative of the client.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With regard to the recognition of third-country firms, and in accordance with the Unionâs international obligations
under the agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation, including the General Agreement on Trade in
Services, decisions determining third-country regulatory and supervisory frameworks as equivalent to the regulatory
and supervisory framework of the Union should be adopted only if the legal and supervisory framework of the
third country provides for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of investment firms authorised under
foreign legal regimes in accordance with, amongst others, the general regulatory goals and standards set out by the
G-20 in September 2009 of improving transparency in the derivatives markets, mitigating systemic risk, and
protecting against market abuse. Such a system should be considered equivalent if it ensures that the substantial
result of the applicable regulatory framework is similar to Union requirements and should be considered effective if
those rules are being applied in a consistent manner.</p>

    <p>A range of fraudulent practices have occurred in spot secondary markets in emission allowances (EUA) which
could undermine trust in the emissions trading scheme, set up by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), and measures are being taken to strengthen the system of EUA registries and

<p>conditions for opening an account to trade EUAs. In order to reinforce the integrity and safeguard the efficient
functioning of those markets, including comprehensive supervision of trading activity, it is appropriate to
complement measures taken under Directive 2003/87/EC by bringing emission allowances fully into the scope
of this Regulation and Directive 2014/65/EU as well as of Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European
Parliament and the Council ( 1 ) and of Directive 2014/57/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 2 ),
by classifying them as financial instruments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of TFEU. In
particular, the delegated acts should be adopted in respect of the extension of the scope of certain provisions of
this Regulation to third-country central banks, specific details concerning definitions, specific cost-related
provisions related to the availability of market data, access to quotes, the sizes at or below which a firm shall
enter into transactions with any other client to whom a quote is available, portfolio compression and the further
determination of when there is a significant investor protection concern or a threat to investor protection, the
orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or commodity markets or to the stability of the whole or
part of the financial system of the Union may warrant ESMA, EBA or competent authoritiesâ action, position
management powers of ESMA, the extension of the transitional period under Article 35(5) of this Regulation for a
certain period of time and in respect of the exclusion of exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of certain
provisions of this Regulation for a certain period of time. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry
out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when
preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of
relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be
conferred on the Commission relating to the adoption of the equivalence decision concerning the third-country
legal and supervisory framework for the provision of services by third-country firms or third-country trading
venues for the purpose of eligibility as trading venues for derivatives subject to the trading obligation and of access
of third-country CCPs and third-country trading venues to trading venues and CCPs established in the Union.
Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament
and of the Council ( 3 ).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to establish uniform requirements relating to financial instruments
in relation to disclosure of trade data, reporting of transactions to the competent authorities, trading of derivatives
and shares on organised venues, non-discriminatory access to CCPs, trading venues and benchmarks, product
intervention powers and powers on position management and position limits, provision of investment services or
activities by third-country firms, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, because, although national
competent authorities are better placed to monitor market developments, the overall impact of the problems
related to trade transparency, transaction reporting, derivatives trading, and bans of products and practices can
only be fully understood in a Union-wide context, but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better
achieved at the Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set
out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in
that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No action taken by any competent authority or ESMA in the performance of their duties should directly or
indirectly discriminate against any Member State or group of Member States as a venue for the provision of
investment services and activities in any currency. No action taken by EBA in the performance of its duties under
this Regulation should directly or indirectly discriminate against any Member State or group of Member States.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical standards in financial services should ensure adequate protection of depositors, investors and consumers
across the Union. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it would be efficient and appropriate to entrust
ESMA, with the elaboration of draft regulatory technical standards which do not involve policy choices, for
submission to the Commission.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Commission should adopt the draft regulatory technical standards developed by ESMA regarding the precise
characteristics of trade transparency requirements, regarding the monetary, foreign exchange and financial stability
policy operations and the types of the certain transactions relevant under this Regulation, regarding the detailed
conditions for waivers from pre-trade transparency, regarding deferred post-trade publication arrangements,
regarding the obligation to make pre-trade and post-trade data available separately, regarding the criteria for the
application of the pre-trade transparency obligations for systematic internalisers, regarding post-trade disclosure by
investment firms, regarding the content and frequency of data requests for the provision of information for the
purposes of transparency and other calculations, regarding transactions that do not contribute to the price
discovery process, regarding the order data to be retained, regarding the content and specifications of transaction
reports, regarding the content and specification of financial instrument reference data, regarding the types of
contracts which have a direct, substantial and foreseeable effect within the Union and the cases where the
trading obligation for derivatives is necessary, regarding the requirements for systems and procedures to ensure
that transactions in cleared derivatives are submitted and accepted for clearing, specifying types of indirect clearing
service arrangements, regarding derivatives subject to an obligation to trade on organised trading venues, regarding
non-discriminatory access to a CCP and to a trading venue, regarding non-discriminatory access to and obligation
to licence benchmarks, and concerning the information that the applicant third-country firm should provide to
ESMA in its application for registration. The Commission should adopt those draft regulatory technical standards
by means of delegated acts pursuant to Article 290 TFEU and in accordance with Articles 10 to 14 of Regulation
(EU) No 1093/2010.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Article 95 of Directive 2014/65/EU provides for a transitional exemption for certain C6 energy derivative
contracts. It is therefore necessary that the technical standards specifying the clearing obligation developed by
ESMA in accordance with Article 5(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 take that into account and do not
impose a clearing obligation on derivative contracts which would subsequently be subject to the transitional
exemption for C6 energy derivative contracts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The application of the requirements in this Regulation should be deferred in order to align applicability with the
application of the transposed rules of the recast Directive and to establish all essential implementing measures. The
entire regulatory package should then be applied from the same point in time. Only the application of the
empowerments for implementing measures should not be deferred so that the necessary steps to draft and
adopt those implementing measures can start as early as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter
of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8),
the freedom to conduct a business (Article 16), the right to consumer protection (Article 38), the right to an
effective remedy and to a fair trial (Article 47), and the right not to be tried or punished twice for the same offence
(Article 50), and has to be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.</p>

<p>( 1 ) Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access to the activity of credit institutions

2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).</p>

<p>To that end, the Commission shall, by 1 June 2015, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council
assessing the treatment of transactions by third-country central banks which for the purposes of this paragraph includes

volumes in the Union. The report shall:</p>

<p>(a) identify provisions applicable in the relevant third countries regarding the regulatory disclosure of central bank
transactions, including transactions undertaken by members of the ESCB in those third countries, and</p>

<p>(b) assess the potential impact that regulatory disclosure requirements in the Union may have on third-country central

counterparty is a third-country central bank carrying out monetary policy, foreign exchange and financial stability
operations, the Commission shall provide that that exemption applies to that third-country central bank.</p>

</ol>

<p>(a) systems matching orders based on a trading methodology by which the price of the financial instrument referred to in
Article 3(1) is derived from the trading venue where that financial instrument was first admitted to trading or the
most relevant market in terms of liquidity, where that reference price is widely published and is regarded by market
participants as a reliable reference price. The continued use of that waiver shall be subject to the conditions set out in
Article 5.</p>

<p>(b) systems that formalise negotiated transactions which are:</p>

<p>(i) made within the current volume weighted spread reflected on the order book or the quotes of the market makers
of the trading venue operating that system, subject to the conditions set out in Article 5;</p>

<p>(ii) in an illiquid share, depositary receipt, ETF, certificate or other similar financial instrument that does not fall

percentage and a reference price set in advance by the system operator; or</p>

<p>(iii) subject to conditions other than the current market price of that financial instrument;</p>

<p>(c) orders that are large in scale compared with normal market size;</p>

admitted to trading or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity; or</p>

<p>(b) when the price referred to in point (a) is not available, the opening or closing price of the relevant trading session.</p>

<p>Orders shall only reference the price referred to in point (b) outside the continuous trading phase of the relevant trading
session.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Where trading venues operate systems which formalise negotiated transactions in accordance with paragraph 1(b)(i):</li>
</ol>

abuse or attempted market abuse in relation to such negotiated transactions in accordance with Article 16 of
Regulation (EU) No 596/2014;</p>

<p>(c) the trading venue shall establish, maintain and implement systems to detect any attempt to use the waiver to
circumvent other requirements of this Regulation or Directive 2014/65/EU and to report attempts to the
competent authority.</p>

<p>Where a competent authority grants a waiver in accordance with paragraph 1(b)(i) or (iii), that competent authority shall
monitor the use of the waiver by the trading venue to ensure that the conditions for use of the waiver are respected.</p>

competent authorities of the intended use of each individual waiver and provide an explanation regarding its functioning,
including the details of the trading venue where the reference price is established as referred to in paragraph 1(a).
Notification of the intention to grant a waiver shall be made not less than four months before the waiver is intended
to take effect. Within two months following receipt of the notification, ESMA shall issue a non-binding opinion to the
competent authority in question assessing the compatibility of each waiver with the requirements established in paragraph
1 and specified in the regulatory technical standard adopted pursuant to paragraph 6. Where that competent authority
grants a waiver and a competent authority of another Member State disagrees, that competent authority may refer the
matter back to ESMA, which may act in accordance with the powers conferred on it under Article 19 of Regulation (EU)
No 1095/2010. ESMA shall monitor the application of the waivers and shall submit an annual report to the Commission
on how they are applied in practice.</li>
  <li>A competent authority may, either on its own initiative or upon request by another competent authority, withdraw
a waiver granted under paragraph 1 as specified under paragraph 6,if it observes that the waiver is being used in a way

trading venue can execute such a transaction;</p>

<p>(d) the negotiated transactions that do not contribute to price formation which avail of the waiver provided for under
paragraph 1(b)(iii);</p>

<p>(e) the size of orders that are large in scale and the type and the minimum size of orders held in an order management
facility of a trading venue pending disclosure for which pre-trade disclosure may be waived under paragraph 1 for
each class of financial instrument concerned;</p>

<p>ESMA shall submit those draft regulatory technical standards to the Commission by 3 July 2015.</p>

<h5 id="volume-cap-mechanism">Volume Cap Mechanism</h5>

<ol>
  <li>In order to ensure that the use of the waivers provided for in Article 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(b)(i) does not unduly harm
price formation, trading under those waivers is restricted as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on a trading venue under those waivers shall be limited
to 4 % of the total volume of trading in that financial instrument on all trading venues across the Union over the
previous 12 months.</p>

<p>(b) overall Union trading in a financial instrument carried out under those waivers shall be limited to 8 % of the total
volume of trading in that financial instrument on all trading venues across the Union over the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>That volume cap mechanism shall not apply to negotiated transactions which are in a share, depositary receipt, ETF,
certificate or other similar financial instrument for which there is not a liquid market as determined in accordance with
Article 2(1)(17)(b) and are dealt within a percentage of a suitable reference price as referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(ii), or to
negotiated transactions that are subject to conditions other than the current market price of that financial instrument as
referred to in Article 4(1)(b)(iii).</p>
<ol>
  <li>When the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on a trading venue under the waivers has
exceeded the limit referred to in paragraph 1(a), the competent authority that authorised the use of those waivers by that
venue shall within two working days suspend their use on that venue in that financial instrument based on the data
published by ESMA referred to in paragraph 4, for a period of six months.</li>
  <li>When the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out on all trading venues across the Union under
those waivers has exceeded the limit referred to in paragraph 1(b), all competent authorities shall within two working
days suspend the use of those waivers across the Union for a period of six months.</li>
</ol>

<p>12.6.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 173/103EN^</p>

<ol>
  <li>ESMA shall publish within five working days of the end of each calendar month, the total volume of Union trading
per financial instrument in the previous 12 months, the percentage of trading in a financial instrument carried out across
the Union under those waivers and on each trading venue in the previous 12 months, and the methodology that is used
to derive those percentages.</li>
  <li>In the event that the report referred to in paragraph 4 identifies any trading venue where trading in any financial
instrument carried out under the waivers has exceeded 3,75 % of the total trading in the Union in that financial
instrument, based on the previous 12 monthsâ trading, ESMA shall publish an additional report within five working
days of the 15th day of the calendar month in which the report referred to in paragraph 4 is published. That report shall
contain the information specified in paragraph 4 in respect of those financial instruments where 3,75 % has been
exceeded.</li>
  <li>In the event that the report referred to in paragraph 4 identifies that overall Union trading in any financial
instrument carried out under the waivers has exceeded 7,75 % of the total Union trading in the financial instrument,
based on the previous 12 monthsâ trading, ESMA shall publish an additional report within five working days of the 15th
on the day of the calendar month in which the report referred to in paragraph 4 is published. That report shall contain
the information specified in paragraph 4 in respect of those financial instruments where 7,75 % has been exceeded.</li>
  <li>In order to ensure a reliable basis for monitoring the trading taking place under those waivers and for determining
whether the limits referred to in paragraph 1 have been exceeded, operators of trading venues shall be obligated to have
in place systems and procedures to:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) enable the identification of all trades which have taken place on its venue under those waivers; and</p>

<p>(b) ensure it does not exceed the permitted percentage of trading allowed under those waivers as referred to in paragraph
1(a) under any circumstances.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The period for the publication of trading data by ESMA, and for which trading in a financial instrument under those
waivers is to be monitored shall start on 3 January 2016. Without prejudice to Article 4(5), competent authorities shall
be empowered to suspend the use of those waivers from the date of application of this Regulation and thereafter on a
monthly basis.</li>
  <li>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the method, including the flagging of transÂ­
actions, by which it collates, calculates and publishes the transaction data, as outlined in paragraph 4, in order to provide
an accurate measurement of the total volume of trading per financial instrument and the percentages of trading that use
those waivers across the Union and per trading venue.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Competent authorities shall be able to authorise market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue
to provide for deferred publication of the details of transactions based on the size or type of the transaction.</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, the competent authorities may authorise the deferred publication in respect of transactions that:</p>

<p>(a) are large in scale compared with the normal market size for that bond, structured finance product, emission
allowance or derivative traded on a trading venue, or for that class of bond, structured finance product, emission
allowance or derivative traded on a trading venue; or</p>

<p>(b) are related to a bond, structured finance product, emission allowance or derivative traded on a trading venue, or a
class of bond, structured finance product, emission allowance or derivative traded on a trading venue for which there
is not a liquid market;</p>

<p>(c) are above a size specific to that bond, structured finance product, emission allowance or derivative traded on a trading
venue, or that class of bond, structured finance product, emission allowance or derivative traded on a trading venue,
which would expose liquidity providers to undue risk and takes into account whether the relevant market participants
are retail or wholesale investors.</p>

<p>Market operators and investment firms operating a trading venue shall obtain the competent authorityâs prior approval of
proposed arrangements for deferred trade-publication, and shall clearly disclose those arrangements to market participants
and the public. ESMA shall monitor the application of those arrangements for deferred trade-publication and shall submit

objective criteria specific to the market for the financial instrument concerned. Such temporary suspension shall be
published on the website of the relevant competent authority.</p>

<p>The temporary suspension shall be valid for an initial period not exceeding three months from the date of its publication
on the website of the relevant competent authority. Such a suspension may be renewed for further periods not exceeding
three months at a time if the grounds for the temporary suspension continue to be applicable. Where the temporary
suspension is not renewed after that three-month period, it shall automatically lapse.</p>

<p>Before suspending or renewing the temporary suspension of the obligations referred to in Article 10, the relevant
competent authority shall notify ESMA of its intention and provide an explanation. ESMA shall issue an opinion to
the competent authority as soon as practicable on whether in its view the suspension or the renewal of the temporary
suspension is justified in accordance with the first and second subparagraphs.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Competent authorities may, in conjunction with an authorisation of deferred publication:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) request the publication of limited details of a transaction or details of several transactions in an aggregated form, or a
combination thereof, during the time period of deferral;</p>

<p>(b) allow the omission of the publication of the volume of an individual transaction during an extended time period of
deferral;</p>

<p>(c) regarding non-equity instruments that are not sovereign debt, allow the publication of several transactions in an
aggregated form during an extended time period of deferral;</p>

<p>(d) regarding sovereign debt instruments, allow the publication of several transactions in an aggregated form for an
indefinite period of time.</p>

<p>In relation to sovereign debt instruments, points (b) and (d) may be used either separately or consecutively whereby once
the volume omission extended period lapses, the volumes could then be published in aggregated form.</p>

<p>In relation to all other financial instruments, when the deferral time period lapses, the outstanding details of the
transaction and all the details of the transactions on an individual basis shall be published.</p>
<ol>
  <li>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify the following in such a way as to enable the
publication of information required under Article 64 of Directive 2014/65/EU:</li>

<p>(a) the details of transactions that investment firms, including systematic internalisers, and market operators and
investment firms operating a trading venue shall make available to the public for each class of financial instrument
concerned in accordance with Article 10(1), including identifiers for the different types of transactions published
under Article 10(1) and Article 21(1), distinguishing between those determined by factors linked primarily to the
valuation of the financial instruments and those determined by other factors;</p>

<p>(b) the time limit that would be deemed in compliance with the obligation to publish as close to real time as possible
including when trades are executed outside ordinary trading hours;</p>

<p>(c) the conditions for authorising investment firms, including systematic internalisers, and market operators and
investment firms operating a trading venue, to provide for deferred publication of the details of transactions for
each class of financial instrument concerned in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article and with Article 21(4);

ARM which is acting on its behalf or a trading venue, the investment firm shall not be responsible for failures in the
completeness, accuracy or timely submission of the reports which are attributable to the ARM or trading venue. In those
cases and subject to Article 66(4) of Directive 2014/65/EU the ARM or trading venue shall be responsible for those
failures.</p>

<h5 id="non-discriminatory-access-to-a-ccp">Non-discriminatory access to a CCP</h5>

<ol>
  <li>Without prejudice to Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, a CCP shall accept to clear financial instruments
on a non-discriminatory and transparent basis, including as regards collateral requirements and fees relating to access,
regardless of the trading venue on which a transaction is executed. This in particular shall ensure that a trading venue has
the right to non-discriminatory treatment of contracts traded on that trading venue in terms of:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts, where the inclusion of such contracts in the
close-out and other netting procedures of a CCP based on the applicable insolvency law would not endanger the
smooth and orderly functioning, the validity or enforceability of such procedures; and</p>

<p>(b) cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP under a risk model that complies with Article 41
of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.</p>

<p>A CCP may require that the trading venue comply with the operational and technical requirements established by the CCP
including the risk management requirements. The requirement in this paragraph does not apply to any derivative contract
that is already subject to the access obligations under Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.</p>

<p>A CCP is not bound by this Article if it is connected by close links to a trading venue which has given notification under
Article 36(5).</p>
<ol>
  <li>A request to access a CCP by a trading venue shall be formally submitted to a CCP, its relevant competent authority
and the competent authority of the trading venue. The request shall specify to which types of financial instruments access
is requested.</li>
</ol>

<p>12.6.2014 Official Journal of the European Union L 173/127EN^</p>

<ol>
  <li>The CCP shall provide a written response to the trading venue within three months in the case of transferable
securities and money market instruments, and within six months in the case of exchange-traded derivatives, either
permitting access, under the condition that a relevant competent authority has granted access pursuant to paragraph
4, or denying access. The CCP may deny a request for access only under the conditions specified in paragraph 6(a). If a
CCP denies access it shall provide full reasons in its response and inform its competent authority in writing of the
decision. Where the trading venue is established in a different Member State to the CCP, the CCP shall also provide such
notification and reasoning to the competent authority of the trading venue. The CCP shall make access possible within
three months of providing a positive response to the access request.</li>
  <li>The competent authority of the CCP or that of the trading venue shall grant a trading venue access to a CCP only
where such access:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) would not require an interoperability arrangement, in the case of derivatives that are not OTC derivatives pursuant to
Article 2(7) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; or</p>

<p>(b) would not threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets, in particular due to liquidity fragmentation,
or would not adversely affect systemic risk.</p>

<p>Nothing in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall prevent access being granted where the request referred to in
paragraph 2 requires interoperability and the trading venue and all CCPs party to the proposed interoperability
arrangement have consented to the arrangement and the risks to which the incumbent CCP is exposed to arising
from inter-CCP positions are collateralised at a third party.</p>

<p>Where the need for an interoperability arrangement is the reason or is part of the reason for denying a request, the
trading venue will advise the CCP and inform ESMA which other CCPs have access to the trading venue and ESMA will
publish that information so that investment firms may choose to exercise their rights under Article 37 of Directive
2014/65/EU in respect of those CCPs in order to facilitate alternative access arrangements.</p>

<p>If a competent authority refuses access it shall issue its decision within two months following receipt of the request
referred to in paragraph 2 and provide full reasons to the other competent authority, the CCP and the trading venue
including the evidence on which the decision is based.</p>
<ol>
  <li>As regards transferable securities and money market instruments, a CCP that has been newly established and
authorised as a CCP as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 to clear under Article 17 of Regulation
(EU) No 648/2012 or recognised under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 or authorised under a pre-existing
national authorisation regime for a period of less than three years on 2 July 2014 may, before 3 January 2017, apply to
its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The competent authority may decide
that this Article does not apply to the CCP in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments, for a
transitional period until 3 July 2019.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 36 or this
Article in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments for the duration of that transitional
arrangement. The competent authority shall notify members of the college of competent authorities for the CCP and
ESMA when a transitional period is approved. ESMA shall publish a list of all notifications that it receives.</p>

<p>Where a CCP which has been approved for the transitional arrangements under this paragraph is connected by close links
to one or more trading venues, those trading venues shall not benefit from access rights under Article 36 or this Article
in respect of transferable securities and money market instruments for the duration of the transitional arrangement.</p>

<p>A CCP which is authorised during the three year period prior to entry into force, but is formed by a merger or acquisition
involving at least one CCP authorised prior to that period, shall not be permitted to apply for the transitional
arrangements under this paragraph.

<ol>
  <li>ESMA shall develop draft regulatory technical standards to specify:</li>

transactions, the number and type of users, arrangements for managing operational risk and complexity or other
factors creating significant undue risks;</p>

<p>(b) the conditions under which access must be permitted by a CCP, including confidentiality of information provided
regarding financial instruments during the development phase, the non-discriminatory and transparent basis as
regards clearing fees, collateral requirements and operational requirements regarding margining;</p>

adversely affect systemic risk;</p>

securities and money market instruments, and within six months in the case of exchange-traded derivatives, either
permitting access, under the condition that the relevant competent authority has granted access pursuant to paragraph
4, or denying access. The trading venue may deny access only under the conditions specified under paragraph 6(a). When
access is denied the trading venue shall provide full reasons in its response and inform its competent authority in writing
of the decision. Where the CCP is established in a different Member State to the trading venue, the trading venue shall

<p>(a) would not require an interoperability arrangement, in the case of derivatives that are not OTC derivatives pursuant to
Article 2(7) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012; or</p>

<p>(b) would not threaten the smooth and orderly functioning of the markets, in particular due to liquidity fragmentation
and the trading venue has put in place adequate mechanisms to prevent such fragmentation, or would not adversely
affect systemic risk.</p>

<p>Nothing in point (a) of the first subparagraph shall prevent access being granted where the request referred to in
paragraph 2 requires interoperability and the trading venue and all CCPs party to the proposed interoperability
arrangement have consented to the arrangement and the risks to which the incumbent CCP is exposed to arising
from inter-CCP positions are collateralised at a third party.</p>

publish that information so that investment firms may choose to exercise their rights under Article 37 of Directive

referred to in paragraph 2 and provide full reasons to the other competent authority, the trading venue and the CCP
including the evidence on which its decision is based.</p>
<ol>
  <li>As regards exchange-traded derivatives, a trading venue which falls below the relevant threshold in the calendar year
preceding the entry into application of this Regulation, may, before the entry into application of this Regulation, notify
ESMA and its competent authority that it does not wish to be bound by this Article for exchange-traded derivatives
included within that threshold, for a period of thirty months from the application of this Regulation. A trading venue
which remains below the relevant threshold in every year of that, or any further, thirty month period may, at the end of
the period, notify ESMA and its competent authority that it wishes to continue to not be bound by this Article for further
thirty months. Where notification is given the trading venue cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or
this Article for exchange-traded derivatives included within the relevant threshold, for the duration of the opt-out. ESMA
shall publish a list of all notifications that it receives.</li>
</ol>

<p>The relevant threshold for the opt-out is an annual notional amount traded of EUR 1 000 000 million. The notional
amount shall be single-counted and shall include all transactions in exchange-traded derivatives concluded under the rules
of the trading venue.</p>

<p>Where a trading venue is part of a group which is connected by close links, the threshold shall be calculated by adding
the annual notional amount traded of all the trading venues in the group as a whole that are based in the Union.</p>

<p>Where a trading venue which has made a notification under this paragraph is connected by close links to one or more
CCPs, those CCPs shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or this Article for exchange-traded derivatives
within the relevant threshold, for the duration of the opt-out.</p>

including the underlying data, of the new benchmark is meaningfully different from any such existing benchmark;

2014/65/EU established throughout the Union without the establishment of a branch where it is registered in the register
of third-country firms kept by ESMA in accordance with Article 47.</li>
  <li>ESMA shall register a third-country firm that has applied for the provision of investment services or performance of
activities throughout the Union in accordance with paragraph 1 only where the following conditions are met:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) the Commission has adopted a decision in accordance with Article 47(1);</p>

<p>(b) the firm is authorised in the jurisdiction where its head office is established to provide the investment services or
activities to be provided in the Union and it is subject to effective supervision and enforcement ensuring a full
compliance with the requirements applicable in that third country;</p>

<p>(c) cooperation arrangements have been established pursuant to Article 47(2).</p>

2014/65/EU and shall not treat third-country firms more favourably than Union firms.</li>
  <li>The third-country firm referred to in paragraph 1 shall submit its application to ESMA after the adoption by the
Commission of the decision referred to in Article 47 determining that the legal and supervisory framework of the third
country in which the third-country firm is authorised is equivalent to the requirements described in Article 47(1).</li>
</ol>

<p>The applicant third-country firm shall provide ESMA with all information necessary for its registration. Within 30
working days of receipt of the application, ESMA shall assess whether the application is complete. If the application
is not complete, ESMA shall set a deadline by which the applicant third-country firm is to provide additional information.</p>

<p>The registration decision shall be based on the conditions set out in paragraph 2.</p>

<p>Within 180 working days of the submission of a complete application, ESMA shall inform the applicant third-country
firm in writing with a fully reasoned explanation whether the registration has been granted or refused.</p>

<p>Member States may allow third-country firms to provide investment services or perform investment activities together

Annex II to Directive 2014/65/EU established or situated in the Union initiates at its own exclusive initiative the
provision of an investment service or activity by a third-country firm, this Article does not apply to the provision of
that service or activity by the third-country firm to that person including a relationship specifically related to the
provision of that service or activity. An initiative by such clients shall not entitle the third-country firm to market
new categories of investment product or investment service to that individual.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Third-country firms providing services or performing activities in accordance with this Article shall, before
providing any service or performing any activity in relation to a client established in the Union, offer to submit any

Directive 2014/65/EU, the competent authority of the Member State where the branch is established and the competent

protection.</p>

<h4 id="article-52">Article 52</h4>
<h5 id="reports-and-review">Reports and review</h5>

<ol>
  <li>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the impact in practice of the transparency obligations established pursuant to Articles 3 to 13, in
particular on the impact of the volume cap mechanism described in Article 5, including on the cost of trading for
eligible counterparties and professional clients and on trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies, and its effecÂ­
tiveness in ensuring that the use of the relevant waivers does not harm price formation and how any appropriate
mechanism for imposing sanctions for infringements of the volume cap might operate, and on the application and
continued appropriateness of the waivers to pre-trade transparency obligations established pursuant to Article 4(2) and (3)
and Article 9(2) to (5).</li>
  <li>The report referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the impact on European equity markets of the use of the waiver
under Article 4(1)(a) and (b)(i) and the volume cap mechanism under Article 5, with particular reference to:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) the level and trend of non-lit order book trading within the Union since the introduction of this Regulation;</p>

<p>(b) the impact on the pre-trade transparent quoted spreads;</p>

<p>(c) the impact on the depth of liquidity on lit order books;</p>

<p>(d) the impact on competition and on investors within the Union;</p>

<p>(e) the impact on trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies;</p>

<p>(f) developments at international level and discussions with third countries and international organisations.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the report concludes that the use of the waiver under Article 4(1)(a) and (b)(i) is harmful to price formation or to
trading of shares of small and mid-cap companies, the Commission shall, where appropriate, make proposals, including
amendments to this Regulation, regarding the use of those waivers. Such proposals shall include an impact assessment of
the proposed amendments, and shall take into account the objectives of this Regulation and the effects on market
disruption and competition, and potential impacts on investors in the Union.</li>
  <li>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the functioning of Article 26, including whether the content and format of transaction reports received
and exchanged between competent authorities comprehensively enable to monitor the activities of investment firms in</li>

<p>accordance with Article 26(1). The Commission may make any appropriate proposals, including providing for transÂ­
actions to be reported to a system appointed by ESMA instead of to competent authorities, which allows relevant
competent authorities to access all the information reported pursuant to this Article for the purposes of this Regulation
and of Directive 2014/65/EU and the detection of insider dealing and market abuse in accordance with Regulation (EU)
No 596/2014.</p>
<ol>
  <li>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on appropriate solutions to reduce information asymmetries between market participants as well as tools for
regulators to better monitor quotation activities on trading venues. That report shall at least assess the feasibility of
developing a European best bid and offer system for consolidated quotes to fulfil those objectives.</li>
  <li>By 3 March 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the progress made in moving trading in standardised OTC derivatives to exchanges or electronic trading
platforms pursuant to Articles 25 and 28.</li>
  <li>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the development in prices for pre-trade and post-trade transparency data from regulated markets, MTFs,
OTFs, APAs and CTPs.</li>
  <li>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council reviewing the interoperability provisions in Article 36 of this Regulation and of Article 8 of Regulation (EU)
No 648/2012.</li>
  <li>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the application of Articles 35 and 36 of this Regulation and of Articles 7 and 8 of Regulation (EU)
No 648/2012.</li>
</ol>

<p>By 3 July 2021, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the
Council on the application of Article 37.</p>
<ol>
  <li>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on the impact of Article 35 and 36 of this Regulation on newly established and authorised CCPs as referred
to in Article 35(5) and trading venues connected to those CCPs by close links and whether the transitional arrangement
provided for in Article 35(5) shall be extended, weighing the possible benefits to consumers of improving competition
and the degree of choice available to market participants against the possible disproportionate effect of those provisions
on newly established and authorised CCPs and the constraints of local market participants in accessing global CCPs and
the smooth functioning of the market.</li>
</ol>

<p>Subject to the conclusions of that report, the Commission may adopt a delegated act in accordance with Article 50 to
extend the transitional period in accordance with Article 35(5) by a maximum of 30 months.</p>
<ol>
  <li>By 3 July 2019, the Commission shall, after consulting ESMA, submit a report to the European Parliament and to
the Council on whether the threshold laid down in Article 36(5) remains appropriate and whether the opt out
mechanism in respect of exchange-traded derivatives is to remain available.</li>
  <li>By 3 July 2016, the Commission shall, based on a risk assessment carried out by ESMA in consultation with the
ESRB, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council assessing the need to temporarily exclude exchange-
traded derivatives from the scope of Article 35 and 36. That report shall take into account risks, if any, resulting from
open access provisions regarding exchange-traded derivatives to the overall stability and orderly functioning of the
financial markets throughout the Union.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Article 7 is amended as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:</p>

<p>â1. A CCP that has been authorised to clear OTC derivative contracts shall accept clearing such contracts on a
non-discriminatory and transparent basis, including as regards collateral requirements and fees related to access,
regardless of the trading venue. This in particular shall ensure that a trading venue has the right to non-
discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts traded on that trading venue are treated in terms of:</p>

<p>(a) collateral requirements and netting of economically equivalent contracts, where the inclusion of such contracts
in the close-out and other netting procedures of a CCP based on the applicable insolvency law would not
endanger the smooth and orderly functioning, the validity or enforceability of such procedures; and</p>

<p>(b) cross-margining with correlated contracts cleared by the same CCP under a risk model that complies with
Article 41.</p>

<p>A CCP may require that a trading venue comply with the operational and technical requirements established by
the CCP, including the risk-management requirements.â;</p>

<p>â6. The conditions laid down in paragraph 1 regarding non-discriminatory treatment in terms of how contracts

national regimes until three years after the adoption by the Commission of a decision in relation to the relevant third
country in accordance with Article 47.</li>
  <li>If the Commission assesses that there is not a need to exclude exchange-traded derivatives from the scope of
Articles 35 and 36 in accordance with Article 52(12), a CCP or a trading venue may, before the entry into application of
this Regulation, apply to its competent authority for permission to avail itself of transitional arrangements. The
competent authority, taking into account the risks resulting from the application of the access rights under Article 35
or 36 as regards exchange-traded derivatives to the orderly functioning of the relevant CCP or trading venue, may decide
that Article 35 or 36 would not apply to the relevant CCP or trading venue, respectively, in respect of exchange-traded
derivatives, for a transitional period until 3 July 2019. Where such a transitional period is approved, the CCP or trading
venue cannot benefit from the access rights under Article 35 or 36, as regards exchange-traded derivatives for the
duration of that transitional period. The competent authority shall notify ESMA, and in the case of a CCP the college of
competent authorities for that CCP, when a transitional period is approved.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where a CCP which has been approved for the transitional arrangements, is connected by close links to one or more
trading venues, those trading venues shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or 36 for exchange-traded
derivatives for the duration of that transitional period.</p>

<p>Where a trading venue, which has been approved for the transitional arrangements, is connected by close links to one or
more CCPs, those CCPs shall not benefit from access rights under Article 35 or 36 for exchange-traded derivatives for the
duration of that transitional period.</p>
