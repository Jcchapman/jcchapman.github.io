Dear Sirs

We refer to the investment management agreement entered into between JCC Investment Management Limited (the **Manager**) and ABC Company Limited (the **Customer**) on 10 February 2012, as amended from time to time (the **Agreement**).

Terms defined in the Agreement shall bear the same meaning when used in this letter unless the context otherwise requires.

Pursuant to clauses 2. 10 and clause 19 of the Agreement, the Customer hereby notifies the Manager and the Manager hereby agrees to:
1. Delete Schedule 1 in its entirety and to replace it with a new Schedule 1 as contained in Appendix 1 to this letter.

The amendments set out in this letter shall have effect from (and including) the date of this letter and the Manager hereby waives the notice period set out in clause 2. 10 of the Agreement.

In all other respects the Agreement remains in full force and effect. In the event of any conflict between this letter and the terms of the Agreement, this letter shall prevail in respect of the subject matter herein.

The agreement and this letter taken together constitute the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to their subject matter and supersede all prior such letters and all oral communications with respect thereto. The parties to this letter do not intend that any of its terms will be enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

This letter, any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it and the relationship between the parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English 
Law and the parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales for the determination of any disputes or claims which arise under or in
connection with this letter.

This letter may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the parties to it on separate counterparts, each of which is an original but all of which together constitute one and the same instrument.

AS WITNESS this letter has been signed by or on behalf of the parties the day and year first before written.

the redemption date, funding the bond purchases by phasing the sale of the
