This Stress Test Data Framework Dictionary sets out the relevant data templates and enumerations permitted in these templates, together with definitions for both. It also describes the data quality rules, patterns for completing data templates, and how data templates are linked to each other (in the “Dimensions” section). This HTML document contains a number of embedded links to help users navigate between sections and templates. The breadcrumb links at the top left of each section can also be used for this purpose. This Dictionary contains details of 39 data templates (see page 3 for a list of the templates), of which the AssetLiabilityManagement template will be submitted outside the Stress Test timeframes. Of these, the following 14 templates form the core data set for 2018:

1.  BalanceSheetProjections
2.  CapitalAndOtherProjections
3.  CorporateSovereignFinInstCreditRisk
4.  CounterpartycreditriskRWA
5.  MarketriskandCVARWA
6.  OperationalRisk
7.  PensionsRisk
8.  RetailExcludingMortgageCredit
9.  RetailMortgageCredit
10.  StructuredFinance
11.  StructuralHedge
12.  MaterialMisconductCostsProjections
13.  MaterialMisconductCostsActuals
14.  FVORWA

The term core data refers to the data that the Bank of England requires each time a concurrent stress test is run, although core data templates may be changed between stress tests. Data that are not currently labelled as ‘core’ (i.e. supplementary) are equally as important as core data. The new template “Basisofpreparationindex” is intended to capture the file names of firms’ answers to each Basis of preparation question in a structured way. The Dictionary also includes a Reconciliation template covering the structured data templates in the 2018 Concurrent Stress Test. [Contents](.\Contents\Contents.html)
